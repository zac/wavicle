 <h1><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1><p><a id="Introduction">wAviCLe's
interface has been made as simple as possible to aid new users. We hope
that this instructional page will allow people who have never tried
using wAviCLe to edit audio files to understand how the program works
and what it is capable of. </a></p><hr><h1><a id="Details">Details</a></h1><p><a id="Details">We will be covering the following topics in discussing how to use wAviCLe: </a></p><ul><li><a id="Details">Requirements to use wAviCLe </a></li><li><a id="Details">Loading and Running wAviCLe </a></li><li><a id="Details">Creating lists of commands in .acf files </a></li><li><a id="Details">Building filters in .flt files. </a></li></ul><hr><h2><a id="Requirements_to_use_wAviCLe">Requirements to use wAviCLe</a></h2><p><a id="Requirements_to_use_wAviCLe">In order to use wAviCLe, you will require the following software on your computer. </a></p><ol><li><a id="Requirements_to_use_wAviCLe">A recent version of the </a><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/" rel="nofollow">ACL2</a> interpreter (currently at ver 3.3) </li><li>A copy of <a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/" rel="nofollow">PLT Scheme</a> to run the program </li><li>A copy of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cce/acl2/" rel="nofollow">drACuLa</a> to allow PLT Scheme to interpret ACL2 code. </li></ol><hr><h2><a id="Loading_and_Running_wAviCLe">Loading and Running wAviCLe</a></h2><p><a id="Loading_and_Running_wAviCLe">Once
the required setup is complete, actually running wAviCLe has been done
on just a couple of commands. To load wAviCLe, you will need to open
the main.lisp file in PLT Scheme and click the "Run" button. This will
load all of the required functions needed to run wAviCLe and open an
interface window in PLT Scheme so that you can get things started. </a></p><p><a id="Loading_and_Running_wAviCLe">Now that everything has been loaded, just enter <tt>(set-state-ok t)</tt> into the interface window and PLT Scheme is ready to run wAviCLe. </a></p><p><a id="Loading_and_Running_wAviCLe">Actually
executing wAviCLe's code has been condensed down to a single command.
The functions and sound files that you want to work with will be read
from a .acf (audio command file) and the commands listed there will be
run in order, so running wAviCLe requires you to use only the following
command: </a></p><blockquote><a id="Loading_and_Running_wAviCLe"><tt>(main "acf" state)</tt> 
</a></blockquote><p><a id="Loading_and_Running_wAviCLe">where acf represents the location of the .acf file. </a></p><hr><h2><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">Creating lists of commands in .acf files</a></h2><p><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">The
.acf files are where most of the user's interaction with wAviCLe takes
place. The program will automatically load .wav audio files, and run
pre-made or user-made filters on them, combine multiple .wav files
together and write the resulting soundwave to it's own audio file or
draw it to a window on the screen. </a></p><p><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">wAviCLe
works in three stages to apply changes to a .wav audio file, all of
these stages are written into the .acf files that wAviCLe reads it's
commands from. To output the results of your filters, wAviCLe uses
these two commands at the beginning of the .acf file: </a></p><ul><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(put-signal output.wav wav-structure)</tt>
- Takes wav-structure, the output from filtered .wav files and other
functions, then writes that to "output.wav" to playback your results in
other audio programs. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(display-signal output.cvs wav-structure)</tt>
- Takes a wav-structure that has been filtered and displays it as a
waveform in a window on the screen. Also writes the amplitudes in the
output to a comma separated values file which can be opened by Excel or
other spreadsheet applications. This allows users to visualize how the
results of their filtering will look when written to a file. </a></li></ul><p><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">Now
that wAviCLe knows where to send the result, you need some sound data
for those functions to output. The lambda function handles all changes
to the wav-structures and provides it's result as another wav-structure
for the output functions to use. To create a lambda function, you
create a single function: </a></p><ul><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(lambda (var-list))</tt>
- Lambda creates a single function that will run several functions
inside of itself. The var-list defines variables that will be used in
the .acf file and can be as long as is needed, as long as each variable
is defined later by an input function. </a></li></ul><p><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">Inside
of the lambda function, a user is free to perform any changes that they
like to an audio file. After the var-list has been defined, the
variables in it can be used with the functions of wAviCLe to create new
wav-structures. The functions that can be used in lambda functions are:
</a></p><ul><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(delay d wav-structure)</tt>
- This function changes the wav-structure by adding d seconds of
silence to the beginning of it. The parameter d will need to be a
number that represents the duration, in seconds, that you want to delay
playback. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(cut t wav-structure)</tt>
- The cut function will remove the first and last t seconds from a
wav-structure. The parameter t will need to be a number that represents
the length of time, in seconds, that you want to remove from the
beginning and end of the wav-structure. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(boost b wav-structure)</tt>
- Boost changes the sound data stored in the wav-structure by
multiplying it's volume by b. Multiplying the volume can make the sound
significantly louder or softer. The parameter b will need to be a
positive number value. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(overdub wav-structure1 wav-structure2)</tt>
- Overdub creates a new wav-structure by playing one structure on top
of another. The result of this function is like playing both of the
wav-structures at the same time. This function can be used to combine
changes to multiple sound files and merge them into one. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(fade-in b wav-structure)</tt>
- Fade-in gradually raises the volume of a wav-structure from 0 up to
it's normal level over the first b seconds of that wav. The result is
good way to begin a .wav sound file gradually. The parameter b needs to
be a positive number that represents the duration in seconds that the
user wants to fade the sound in. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(fade-out e wav-structure)</tt>
- Fade-out gradually lowers the volume of a wav-structure from it's
normal level down to 0 over the last e seconds of that wav. The result
is good way to let a .wav sound file end gradually and quietly. The
parameter e needs to be a positive number that represents the duration
in seconds that the user wants to fade the sound out. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(fuzz f wav-structure)</tt>
- Fuzz sets a maximum volume for a wav-structure. The parameter f sets
a value between 0 and 1 where the volume of the wav-structure will have
a maximum value of f times the maximum value that the wav-structure can
handle. Setting f to 0 would mute the wav-structure while setting f to
1 would leave the wav-structure unchanged. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(chipmunk c wav-structure)</tt>
- The chipmunk feature allows users to speed up or slow down the
playback of of a sound file. This change also affects the pitch of the
sound being played back so it can be used to make funny changes to your
sound files. The parameter c represents a number to multiply the
playback speed by. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(filter filter wav-structure)</tt>
- The filter function uses a filter read from a .flt file described
below, to run a user-defined filter on a wav-structure. The filter will
be read from a separate file and can be read defined however the user
likes. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(echo d v wav-structure)</tt>
- The echo function creates an echo effect. The wav-structure is
divided up by every d seconds of audio and every d seconds of audio is
repeated with it's volume reduced by v. The parameter d represents the
length of time in seconds of the audio that you would like to repeat
and the parameter v is the amount each section with be boosted by on
each repeat. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(reverse wav-structure)</tt> - The reverse function takes a wav-structure and changes the audio so that it plays in reverse. </a></li></ul><p><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">After
a lambda function has been defined using the above functions, the
variables that the lambda function uses need to be defined. In order to
create the initial wav-structures and filters that the lambda function
operations, the following functions are used: </a></p><ul><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(get-signal sample.wav)</tt>
- Read the file "sample.wav" from your hard disk and creates a
wav-structure in order to allow wAviCLe to run it's filters on it. </a></li><li><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files"><tt>(get-filter filter.flt)</tt> - Read a user-made filter to be applied to the data in a wav-structure. </a></li></ul><p><a id="Creating_lists_of_commands_in_.acf_files">Note: File path may not contain any spaces when loading either wav files or filters. </a></p><hr><h3><a id="Sample_.acf_file">Sample .acf file</a></h3><p><a id="Sample_.acf_file">Once
the pieces of the lambda function have been brought together, defined,
and sent to an output function, the result should be a single file that
wAviCLe can read, interpret, and understand to perform the functions
that it is being used for. </a></p><p><a id="Sample_.acf_file">An example of a sample .acf file would be: </a></p><pre class="prettyprint"><a id="Sample_.acf_file"><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">put</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">signal output</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">wav<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="pun">((</span><span class="kwd">lambda</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">f input1 input2</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">overdub </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">filter f input1</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">chipmunk </span><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pln"> input2</span><span class="pun">)))</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">get</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">filter test</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">flt</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">get</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">signal samples</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">voice1</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">wav</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">get</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">signal samples</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">voice2</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">wav</span><span class="pun">)))</span></a></pre><p><a id="Sample_.acf_file">The
above .acf file is designed to run several of the functions available
to it. The program starts at the bottom of the file and reads a filter
(test.flt) as well as two wav files (samples/voice1.wav and
samples/voice2.wav). The lambda function stores the filter as f and the
wav files as a wav-structures input1 and input2 respectively. </a></p><p><a id="Sample_.acf_file">Once
the files have been read into structures in memory, the lambda function
applies the filter to the first wav-structure and doubles the speed of
the second wav-structure and reverses it's audio. The overdub function
then takes the results of these two operations and dubs one over the
other. The result of these changes is then sent to the put-signal
operation and written out to a file called output.wav that can be
opened in other audio processing programs. </a></p><hr><h2><a id="Building_filters_in_.flt_files">Building filters in .flt files</a></h2><p><a id="Building_filters_in_.flt_files">The
.flt files bring flexibility to wAviCLe by allowing users to create
their own filters when none of the built-in functions perform the
function that the user wants. Each .flt file consists of a list of
numbers between -1 and 1, separated by commas. For each of these
numbers, wAviCLe will take a sample of sound from the .wav file,
multiply the filter value and the sample value together, then sum the
products of each of those calculations together to create a new sample
value for a new wav-structure. </a></p><p><a id="Building_filters_in_.flt_files">A user may create as many filters as they like in an .flt file, for example: </a></p><p><a id="Building_filters_in_.flt_files"><tt>0.33,0.33,0.33</tt> </a></p><p><a id="Building_filters_in_.flt_files">will
take the first three samples from a wav-structure, multiply them all by
1/3, then add them together and make them the first sample on a new
wav-structure before moving up to perform the same function on samples
2, 3, and 4 of the old wav-structure and so-on until wAviCLe runs out
of samples to filter. The resulting new wav-structure can then be
written to a file by (put-signal) or displayed to the screen by
(display-signal). </a></p></body></html>
