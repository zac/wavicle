 distinguish it from the ACL2 prompt.

 NOTE!!  Proof trees are disabled in ACL2.  To enable them in emacs,
 look under the ACL2 source directory in interface/emacs/README.doc; 
 and, to turn on proof trees, execute :START-PROOF-TREE in the ACL2 
 command loop.   Look in the ACL2 documentation under PROOF-TREE.
