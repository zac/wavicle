= Dr. Page's Stylesheet =

* Programming tools
 * Software development environment: DrACuLa
 * Programming language: ACL2 subset of Common Lisp
 * Admissibility: ACL2 must admit to its logic all functions and theorems in your project. In other words, the Admit All button in DrACuLa must highlight in green all the definitions in your code.
* Format requirements
 * Indentation reflects structure of formulas
 * Variable names connote usage
 * Line length: no lines longer than 70 characters
 * No tab characters
* Internal documentation requirements
 * Usage notes accompany each defined function explaining how to invoke the function and what results to expect.
 * A test suite accompanies each defined function with notes explaining how to carry out tests and what results to expect. The test suite is clearly marked to associate it with the function it tests.
 * Each theorem accompanies the definition of the last defined function that the theorem refers to, following the test suite for that function.
 * Note: The project description will indicate whether or not theorems are required. Some projects do not require theorems.
