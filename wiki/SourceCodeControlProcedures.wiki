Source-code control procedures
 * Commit as often as possible.
 * Code must compile when it is committed.
 * Make sure all required files for compilation and operation are included in the repository.
 * Every commit must have a comment describing what changes have been made and what issues have been solved if applicable.
 * If major changes are going to be made, they must be made in a branch.
 * Branches will be merged when the entire team feels that a branch is stable enough to merge to the trunk.
 * Keep backups of files and compiled binaries and books out of the repository.
