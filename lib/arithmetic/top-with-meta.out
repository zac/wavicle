 Note: We have modified the prompt in some underlying Lisps to further
 distinguish it from the ACL2 prompt.

 NOTE!!  Proof trees are disabled in ACL2.  To enable them in emacs,
 look under the ACL2 source directory in interface/emacs/README.doc; 
 and, to turn on proof trees, execute :START-PROOF-TREE in the ACL2 
 command loop.   Look in the ACL2 documentation under PROOF-TREE.
